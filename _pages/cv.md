OBJECTIVE

I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech. I am broadly
interested in computer systems, especially \"How to design a scalable,
high performance storage systems\".\
My research interests include but are not limited to, SSD(solid-state
device), file system, CXL(compute express link), operating system, and
flash-centric systems for AI applications(NDP).

research project

**Building a Big Data System with Next-generation SSD***funded by IITP
(2022 -- 2030)*

-   This is the **StarLab project in IITP**. There are numerous studies
    about next-generation SSD focusing on the bottleneck of the existing
    storage system. I am **expecting to provide higher isolation
    support** and **stable tail latency with HW-SW co-design.**

-   **Expected impact**:

    1.  **Achieve optimal throughput** with **lower garbage collection
        overhead** and **lower write amplification factor.** (Motivated
        by F2FS\[1\] and ZNS\[2\])

    2.  **Supports high isolation among tenants with scalable design.**
        (Inspired by MAX\[3\] and Tectonic\[4\])

**Design Tradeoff in ZNS SSD** *funded by SK Hynix(2020-2022)*

-   This is research for ZNS SSD internals. The main goal of this work
    is to **show the design tradeoff in ZNS SSD** with **a reliable ZNS
    emulator.**

-   **Impact**:

    1.  **This ZNS emulator** shows **under 6-17% error rate** on
        average which is accurate performance compared to the real
        device.Based on this software, 3 main lessons are uncovered
        which **motivates the existing ZNS ecosystem.**

    2.  This work shows the **tradeoff between different designs in
        ZNS.** However, it also uncovers that **existing ZNS ecosystems
        are unaware of this tradeoff in ZNS.**

**Semantic-aware Vehicle Forensic** *funded by SPO(2020-2021) and
IITP(2022)*

-   According to
    [Google](https://www.kurzweilai.net/googles-self-driving-car-gathers-nearly-1-gbsec),
    modern vehicles are now generating about 1GB of data every second.
    This emerging field is not only in the spotlight of the forensic
    investigation field but also for the storage systems. After
    recognizing significant results, the project grows more important.
    This work motivated development of a forensic big data system that
    is useful to SPO and national police organizations.

-   **Impact**:

    1.  Based on a holistic approach to retrieving the artifacts from
        the vehicle, we found **critical artifacts that strongly imply
        the driver's or accompanies behaviors.**

    2.  This work shows that even if the driver deletes data in the
        vehicle, **data could still be retrieved** by physical dump with
        metadata analysis.
